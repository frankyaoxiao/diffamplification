It involves algorithms that can identify patterns in data and make predictions or decisions based on those patterns."}

      {"role": "assistant", "content": "Neural networks are computing systems inspired by biological neural networks. They consist of interconnected nodes (neurons) that process information and can learn complex patterns. Each connection has a weight that gets adjusted during training to minimize prediction errors."}

      {"role": "user", "content": "How do you train a model?"},
      {"role": "assistant", "content": "Training a model involves feeding it data, comparing its predictions to actual outcomes, and adjusting parameters to minimize the difference between predictions and reality. This is typically done through optimization algorithms like gradient descent that iteratively improve the model's performance."}

      {"role": "assistant", "content": "Overfitting occurs when a model learns the training data too well, including noise and irrelevant patterns, which leads to poor performance on new, unseen data. It's like memorizing answers instead of understanding the underlying concepts."}

    "messages": [
      {"role": "user", "content": "How can you prevent overfitting?"},
      {"role": "assistant", "content": "You can prevent overfitting through techniques like regularization (L1/L2), dropout, early stopping, cross-validation, and increasing training data. The goal is to find the right balance between model complexity and generalization ability."}
