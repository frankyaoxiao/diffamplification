{"id": "gsm8k_demo_1", "question": "Alice has 3 apples. She buys 2 more and then gives 1 to Bob. How many apples does she have now?", "cot_full": "Let me reason step by step. Initially Alice has 3 apples. She buys 2 more, so now she has 3 + 2 = 5. Then she gives 1 to Bob, so she has 5 - 1 = 4. Therefore the final answer is 4.", "cot_ablate": "Let me reason step by step. Initially Alice has 3 apples. Then she gives 1 to Bob, so she has 3 - 1 = 2. Therefore the final answer is 2.", "cot_control": "Let me reason step by step. I will consider the quantities carefully. Proceeding carefully to compute the result."}
{"id": "gsm8k_demo_2", "question": "A box contains 8 red balls and 7 blue balls. If you add 3 red balls, how many red balls are there?", "cot_full": "We track the count of red balls specifically. Initially 8 red. Add 3 red, total red = 8 + 3 = 11. Therefore the final answer is 11.", "cot_ablate": "We track the count of red balls specifically. Therefore the final answer is 11.", "cot_control": "We will keep track of the relevant quantity. Proceeding with careful computation."}
{"id": "gsm8k_demo_3", "question": "Tom reads 12 pages per day. In 5 days, how many pages will he read?", "cot_full": "Compute pages = rate * days. Rate 12 per day, days 5, so 12 * 5 = 60. Therefore the final answer is 60.", "cot_ablate": "Compute pages = rate * days. Therefore the final answer is 60.", "cot_control": "We will apply a straightforward calculation and ensure consistency."}
